## Key Patterns
- Total transactions: 1,030
- Total notional volume: $21,633,775.10
- Buy/Sell mix: BUY 507 vs SELL 523 (BUY ratio 49.2%)

## Concentrations / Imbalances
- Top 3 tickers by notional: MSFT ($8,896,849.90), AAPL ($4,797,093.65), GOOGL ($3,867,912.65)
- Concentration proxy: top3 notional share ≈ 81.2%

- Most active trader: T001 with 344 transactions.

## Suggested Follow-ups
- Validate whether large net positions align with risk limits (per-ticker exposure).
- Review the top trader’s trades for potential concentration or repeated intraday activity.
- If there are spikes, inspect the underlying tickers and timestamps for that day.
